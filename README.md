### Issues: Merging Branch
I had no trouble completing this assignment until I got to merging the branch. I've personally never worked on branches before, so I'm not familiar with troubleshooting the problems. When I tried to merge content.test into master, I got this error message:

CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in index.html
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result

Naturally, I had no idea what this meant - so I googled it. There was a suggestion from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5827944/git-error-on-commit-after-merge-fatal-cannot-do-a-partial-commit-during-a-mer) that involved using git commit -i index.html. It appeared to work, so I carried on and pushed everything to Github.
